Do they just not worry about every little detail? I've never known a gorilla to read and study carefully 
seventeen books on bringing up baby gorillas. And they seem to know just what to do. They never worry about 
spoiling their little gorilla babies. They never worry about not having enough time with them. Now, don't get 
me wrong, I'd rather be human than a gorilla any day. Just imagine having to sit in a zoo. (Did you figure out yet that 
while gorillas were on my mind, I could only find a picture of an elephant?)
