       <h3>  What is my website about? </h3>
        The website will be consisting a lot of information about Paris, France. 
        <h3> What is the objective of my website? </h3>
          The objective of my website is to deliver useful information so that it can help people from planning a trip to Paris.
            This site would be important since it is quite necessary but also tiring thing to look for all the different information to plan a trip. 
            I am also finding it hard to have relative or useful planning sites to refer right now, planning a trip.
        <h3> My target audience </h3>
         Apparently the target audience will be those who prepare for the trip to Paris. Especially those do not have much information and planning to have a trip by herself/himself or with a small group of people.
        To be more specific, the target might be focused to college students who try to spend about 3-7 days in Paris.  
        
        <h3> Content that I'm going to include </h3> 
         The site can provide a tips for preparing for a trip (things to bring, things to be aware of, weather, places to go, transportation methods, pre-tickets, etc)
        Then, I can provide some of my experience since I've been to Paris as a tourist twice before and will be going this thanksgiving.
        This could be recommendation of routes of efficient traveling so that the audience can reduce wasting time; I can add some recommendation of places to visit, good hotels or good hostels, good place for the photo, must-go restaurants and must-go shopping stores.
        I can always use my own pictures for the audience can refer.I will have to think about the specific layout of the websites later on but will have lots of information about Paris.
